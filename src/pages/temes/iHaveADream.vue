      I Have a Dream, a song to sing <br />
      To help me cope, with anything <br />
      If you see the wonder, of a fairy tale <br />
      You can take the future, even if you fail <br />
      <br />
      I believe in angels <br />
      Something good in everything I see <br />
      I believe in angels <br />
      When I know the time is right for me <br />
      I'll cross the stream, I Have a Dream <br />
      <br />
      I Have a Dream, a fantasy <br />
      To help me through, reality <br />
      And my destination, makes it worth the while <br />
      Pushin' through the darkness, still another mile <br />
      <br />
      I believe in angels <br />
      Something good in everything I see <br />
      I believe in angels <br />
      When I know the time is right for me <br />
      I'll cross the stream, I Have a Dream <br />
      I'll cross the stream, I Have a Dream <br />
      <br />
      I Have a Dream, a song to sing <br />
