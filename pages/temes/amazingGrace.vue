    <h3>Amazing Grace</h3>
    <p>
      Amazing grace how sweet the sound <br />
      That saved a wretch like me <br />
      I once was lost, but now I'm found <br />
      Was blind but now I see <br />
      <br />
      'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear <br />
      And grace my fears relieved <br />
      How precious did that grace appear <br />
      The hour I first believed <br />
      <br />
      Through many dangers, toils, and snares <br />
      I have already come <br />
      This grace that brought me safe thus far <br />
      And grace will lead me home <br />
      <br />
      When we've been here ten thousand years <br />
      Bright, shining as the sun <br />
      We've no less days to sing God's praise <br />
      Than when we first begun <br />
      <br />
      Amazing grace how sweet the sound <br />
      That saved a wretch like me <br />
      I once was lost, but now I'm found <br />
      Was blind but now I see
